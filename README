Currently `opencl` branch uses Boost.Compute to support OpenCL backend.
Main modifications:
* add `function_with_external_function` in order to package a functor with its dependencies together so that calling functions like `boost::compute::transform` will be easier. 
  * see `Pipeline/hd/utils/external_function.dp.cpp`
  * Note: don't know whether Boost.Compute has something similar already
* all functor's `operator()` has been modified to return a `boost::compute::function`/`closure`/some wrapper, so `transform(begin, end, functor(parameter))` -> `transform(begin, end, functor(parameter)())`
  * original proposal is converting a functor into a function which returns a `boost::compute::function`/... , but this leads to dangling references inside closure captures
  * another proposal is using implicit type converting like `operator decltype(auto)` but this lead to `error: no class template named ‘result’ in ‘struct functor’`
* support capturing a `boost::compute::buffer_iterator` as a parameter of `boost::compute::closure`
  * see `Pipeline/hd/utils/meta_kernel.dp.hpp`
* add `device_vector_wrapper` to support `resize(size_type n, T x)`
  * see `Pipeline/hd/utils/wrappers.dp.hpp`
* add `copy_if` and `transform_if` with parameter stencil
  * see `Pipeline/hd/utils/copy_if.dp.hpp` and `Pipeline/hd/utils/transform_if.dp.hpp`
* modified `scatter_if` to remove duplicated buffer offset (this offset has been already included in buffer_iterator)
  * see `Pipeline/hd/utils/scatter_if.dp.hpp`
