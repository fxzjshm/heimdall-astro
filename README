WARNING: the result is quite different from original version, not sure whether the compiler or DPCT library should be responsible for this. (See commit 4d94810)

Currently `sycl` branch only support Intel's OneAPI (waiting for more implementations of SYCL 2020 and a substitution of dpct).
Run `./configure` with prefix `CC=dpcpp CXX=dpcpp` to build.
